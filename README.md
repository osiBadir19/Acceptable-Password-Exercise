In this mission, you need to create a password verification function.

*The verification condition is:*

- *the length should be bigger than 6.*

***Input**: A string.*

***Output**: A bool.*

Examples:

1. assert is\_acceptable\_password("short") == False
1. assert is\_acceptable\_password("muchlonger") == True
1. assert is\_acceptable\_password("ashort") == False
